# 5217 language localisation

To localise to your language either send a pull request with the translation + respective directory (eg. spanish, french) or send me an e-mail with the translated strings and I'll upload them here.

The strings.xml structure is like this:

```xml
<string name="dont_touch_this_id">Text to translate</string>
```
